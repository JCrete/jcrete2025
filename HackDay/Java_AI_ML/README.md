# Java for AI/ML

Convenors: Charles Nutter, Sven Reimers, Zoran Sevarac

If you want to start learning Data Science, Aritificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), today, everybody (books, university courses, blogs etc.) point you to Python. The Java ecosystem does have tools, but they aren't that famous:

What needs to be done to bring Java as a Mainstream AI/ML language?

* We need to go through the basic tutorial examples and try to run them in the equivalent Java tools and see what's missing.
* Create courses/tutorials for AI/ML in Java

Currently you can contibute to the following projects (list to be updated):

* [https://github.com/jtaccuino/jtaccuino](JTaccuino) an equivalent to [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) but written in JavaFX
* [Deepnets](https://github.com/deepnetts) a Deep Learning library for Developers

And, there is [AI Collective](https://www.aicollective.com/), a collaboration framework worldwide to promote AI. If your country is not represented yet, and you wish to do that, please create a [chapter](https://www.aicollective.com/chapters/start)!
