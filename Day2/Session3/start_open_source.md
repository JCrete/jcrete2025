# How to get started in Open Source?

*Convenor*: Kaya

*Subject*: how and where to start when someone wants to contribute to an open source project?

### Which project to choose?
Pick a project that interests you, that you already use, or one where you have found an issue yourself. Choose something you’ll enjoy working on, as it will be your free time you’re giving up.
You can also select a project you want to use in a future job or assignment to gain deeper knowledge.

Projects from foundations like Eclipse or Apache are good options, as the projects are often well organized.

Projects looking for help can be found through initiatives like Hackergarten, Hacktoberfest, or hack.commit.push.

### Evaluate the project
Check if the project has proper documentation and starting guides. If these are missing, ask for them.

Some projects provide contribution guidelines or label issues suitable for newcomers.

Also, consider how many people are contributing; projects with larger communities often provide better support.

### How to start contributing
Begin by communicating with the project. Learn their processes and understand what they need. Join their channels or mailing lists. Treat it like joining a new company: get to know the people and their way of working.

Contributions are not limited to code. You can also provide use cases, improve or translate documentation, or create code examples.

Even without deep knowledge of the project, you can add value by bringing in real business problems, offering a new perspective, and noticing unclear or incorrect documentation.

### Important for later on
Familiarize yourself with the legal aspects, including licenses for dependencies and any rules your employer may have regarding the rights of the code you contribute.
