# Stay up-to-date with tech

*Convenor*: Kaya

*Subject*: new technologies emerge constantly, how do we keep up-to-date with them and also keep focus.

### Recognise concepts
New technologies are often based on existing/known concepts. The more experienced you are, the easier it gets to recognise these concepts. Instead of having to learn about every new technology, you know what concepts it uses and that's often enough.

### You don't need to know everything
The requirements in vacancies are often not realistic. They ask for (in depth) knowledge about multiple fields. But you don't need to know everything. Employers hope to find someone who knows it all, but that's not realistic. (Unfortunately women tend to only apply when ticking all the boxes.)

Focus on the concept of being T-shaped; a combination of specialized knowledge in one field and broad knowledge across multiple fields. It's not needed to be an expert in every field, but it helps to have basic skills and understanding. 

### Understand the basics
When you hear about a new technology, start with getting a basic understanding. Read about it (or obtain the information in whatever way works the best for you). 
Dive into the technology at the moment you need it and actually want to learn it.

Notice who the experts are about the topic. So that, when needed, you can go to them and ask for explanation.

### Resources/news
It's difficult that Twitter isn't the place to go anymore for finding out about new technologies. People are on different platforms nowadays.
Sources to hear about new technology: podcasts, mailings lists, YouTube.
